/// This protocol defines the public API of the wrapper
/// around login providers, such as Sign in with Apple.
///
/// When using the library in your code always make sure to
/// reference this protocol instead of the default implementation `UserManager`,
/// as this protocol will always conform to Semantic Versioning.

  /// Sign in with Apple in the passed view controller.
  ///
  /// Before using this function, you must enable Sign in with Apple under the "Signing & Capabilities" tab of
  /// your target. Also, you must turn on Sign in with Apple in your Firebase Console, if you haven't already.
  ///
  /// The Sign in with Apple flow will be different for new users and returning users; as a result, in the latter case, the library
  /// will not be able to retrieve the user's display name, as Apple does not provide this information for returning users.
  /// Keep in mind that the account you are creating using this function will be linked to the user's Apple ID, but that link
  /// will only work in one direction: from Apple to Firebase; if you delete the Firebase account, the user will still find your app
  /// in their Apple ID settings, under "Apps Using Your Apple ID".
  ///
  /// To use Sign in with Apple, your app must comply with specific terms. We strongly suggest you to review them before
  /// starting the implementation: you can find those on the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/).
  /// Additionally, if your app also provides the option to sign in/sign up with another provider (such as Google) and you're targeting the public App Store,
  /// [you must also support Sign in with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#sign-in-with-apple).
  ///
  /// - parameters:
  ///     - viewController: The view controller over which the Sign in with Apple UI should be displayed.
  ///     - updateUserDisplayName: If set to `true`, a successful login will also update the user `displayName` field using information from the associated Apple ID.
  ///     - allowMigration: An optional boolean that defines the behavior in case there is an anonymous user logged-in and the user is trying to login in an existing account. This option will be passed back to the caller
  ///     in the resulting `LoginDescriptor.performMigration`; if set to `nil`, the operation will not proceed and a `UserError.migrationRequired` error will be thrown.
  /// - returns: A Single that emits errors or a `LoginDescriptor` instance.
